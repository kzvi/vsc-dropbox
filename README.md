# Dropbox for VS Code

This extension uses the `FileSystemProvider` API to allow accessing Dropbox in VS Code. This is a web extension, so it works in the browser, for example on `vscode.dev`.

This extension is currently only a minimal wrapper around the Dropbox API.

## How to use

After installing the extension, open the command palette and run the command "Dropbox: Open Dropbox".

You can also use the command "Dropbox: Authenticate" to log in to Dropbox.
